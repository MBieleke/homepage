abstract: "Enduring cognitive or physical performance over extended periods of time is an important ability in daily life, prototypically required in many athletic, educational, and vocational contexts. A critical requirement for maintaining performance at a high level is that individuals continuously self-regulate various affective experiences (e.g., pain or boredom), thoughts (e.g., related to distractions or quitting), and behaviors (e.g., responding to feedback or increasing effort). The ubiquitous importance of self-regulation for performance has been recognized across psychological disciplines. In this special issue, we draw upon diverse insights from these disciplines to better understand the self-regulation of human performance."
