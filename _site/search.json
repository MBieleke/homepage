It covers the component structure of various emotions across three diffent academic settings. However, this breadth requires a total of 232 items distributed across 24 scales, making the AEQ difficult to use when administration time is limited. The AEQ-S addresses this issue by reducing the number of items to 96 (i.e., 4 items per scale), allowing much more economic assessments. Despite its brevity, the AEQ-S is a reliable instrument that reproduces the informatoin obtained with the AEQ and taps into the same nomological network."

Each section consists of eight scales, and each scale comprises four items pertaining to an individual achievement emotion.\nThe AEQ-S maintains the component structure of the AEQ as well.

The AEQ-S is a modular instrument, allowing researcher to use sections (e.g., learning-related emotions) and scales (e.g., test anxiety) individually. This reduces the administration time accordingly; for instance, a single scale with four items can be completed in less than a minute. Participants rate each of the eight items on a 5-point Likert scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree).\n\n\nInstruction\nThe instructions used for the AEQ-S focus on general emotional experiences across subjects (i.e., traits). However, they can also be changed to focus on emotions in a specific subject domain (e.g., math) and/or emotions in a specific situation (i.e., states). It is not necessary to change the wording of the items.\n\n\nScoring and interpretation\nAn overall score for each scale is obtained by averaging a participant’s ratings across all four items. All items are formulated in the same direction so that no reverse-coding is neccessary."

However, it is worth noting that the items of the AEQ-S are drawn form a broader pool of original AEQ items. Consequently, it would be possible to use translations of the original AEQ to translate the AEQ-S.
