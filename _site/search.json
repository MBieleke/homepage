This neglect is perplexing, especially considering that endurance sports can have characteristics conducive to boredom. To fill this gap, we investigated boredom in endurance sports, along with its antecedents and consequences, through the lens of control-value theory (CVT). In a study involving 667 recreational runners and cyclists, we found support for CVT’s predictions. Specifically, lower levels of self-concept, greater levels of underchallenge and overchallenge, as well as lower levels of value were all linked to increased boredom. In turn, higher levels of boredom were associated with more negative psychological (e.g., less satisfaction) and behavioral consequences (e.g., reduced training). Few differences emerged between runners and cyclists, and these differences were primarily in the magnitude of effects. Overall, our research demonstrates that CVT is a promising theoretical framework for studying boredom in sports and exercise. Conversely, endurance sports provides a natural environment in which people experience boredom, and studying boredom in this context might thus provide novel insights into boredom research and CVT. This perspective also suggests actionable insights for practitioners and researchers to mitigate boredom more effectively. \n\n\n\n\n\n2025\n\n\nMaik Bieleke, Wanja Wolff, Catharina Cremer, Fanni Kaisinger, Thomas Goetz\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDifferent functions of physical effort: A scoping review of the value of physical effort in physical activity and sports\n\n\nMotivation and Emotion\n\n\n\njournal article\n\n\nconceptual paper\n\n\n\nPsychologists have long been intrigued by effort and its underlying motivations. Effort serves multiple functions: a costly instrument, a reward, and adding value to outcomes. Although physical effort is a defining concept of sports, work on conceptualizing its functions in this context is lacking. Here, we aim to fill this gap by examining the existing sports and physical activity literature, especially focusing on how the value-generating functions have been addressed in previous research. To ensure comprehensive coverage, a machine-learning approach (ASReview) was employed for efficient paper screening, resulting in a total of N = 20 relevant articles from an initial pool of 28,079 identified articles. Several of these articles provided evidence that physical effort can be inherently rewarding and add value to an outcome. Moreover, several research focal points could be identified: the generalization of effort’s value across domains, developmental aspects, neural correlates of effort valuation, and different measurement approaches used to assess the value of physical effort. There is still a dearth of research investigating the value of physical effort in sports and exercise. A coherent theoretical framework, such as the Expected Value of Control theory and standardized measurement methods, may aid future research in understanding effort’s different functions. \n\n\n\n\n\n2025\n\n\nJohanna Stähler, Maik Bieleke, Wanja Wolff, Julia Schüler\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA novel approach to analysing cognitive and physical effort in a unified motor task\n\n\nPsyArXiv\n\n\n\npreprint\n\n\noriginal research\n\n\n\nMany everyday tasks and sports activities require the simultaneous engagement of cognitive and physical effort. While cognitive and physical effort have been extensively studied independently, their concurrent interplay remains underexplored due to a lack of suitable task paradigms. To address this gap, we introduce a novel pegboard system designed to independently and simultaneously manipulate cognitive and physical effort within one motor task. Participants place pegs into holes under varying cognitive demand (e.g., memorizing and switching light patterns indicating target holes, with task demands modulated by the probability of pattern changes) and physical demands (e.g., overcoming resistance, with task demands modulated by hole distances or required force). Across two within-subject studies (n = 20, n = 50), we examined how systematically varying task demands in the pegboard system influence perceived effort. Attesting to its validity, increasing task demands elicited domain-specific increases in perceived effort. Participants rated more cognitively demanding tasks as more cognitively effortful and more physically demanding tasks as more physically effortful, with graded increases in perceived effort corresponding to demand levels. These findings align with contemporary models of effort and demonstrate the suitability of the pegboard system for studying cognitive and physical effort concurrently in a unified motor task. This paves the way for future research on the interplay between cognitive and physical effort, addressing theoretical gaps and offering practical applications in sports, healthcare, and occupational settings. \n\n\n\n\n\n2025\n\n\nJonathan Wientges, Maik Bieleke, Wanja Wolff, Ursula Fischer, Julia Schüler\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEffort and boredom shape our experience of time\n\n\nPsyArXiv\n\n\n\npreprint\n\n\ntheory development\n\n\n\nSituations change over time, and so does our experience of them. For example, a task may initially feel engaging but can, over time, become monotonous and boring. Similarly, as processing demands increase or one’s momentary capabilities decline, the same task can feel more or less effortful. The dynamics of these task-induced sensations matter because boredom and perceived effort shape behavior by driving optimization of resource utilization. A fundamental resource people do not want to waste is time. Here, we propose that the sensations of boredom and effort influence how the passing of time is experienced. Specifically, both states are linked to changes in interoception—the perception of internal bodily signals—which is known to play a key role in time perception. This proposal offers a framework for understanding how fundamental regulatory sensations, such as boredom and effort, shape temporal experience through interoceptive mechanisms. We highlight the insular cortex as a potential hub mediating the effects of interoceptive signals on time perception, integrating feelings of boredom and effort, and their influence on the experience of time. \n\n\n\n\n\n2025\n\n\nWanja Wolff, Sena Özay-Otgonbayar, James Danckert, Maik Bieleke, Corinna S.

Ziele zu erreichen ist ungleich schwieriger, da situativ attraktiver erscheinende Handlungsalternativen willentlich unterdrückt werden müssen und stattdessen als aversiv wahrgenommene Verhaltensweisen auszuführen sind (z. B. Training bei schlechtem Wetter) bzw. auf attraktivere Verhaltensweisen zu verzichten ist (z. B. Ausruhen auf dem Sofa). Dieser willentliche Kontrollprozess wird als Selbstkontrolle bezeichnet. Die daraus resultierende Lücke zwischen den gesetzten Zielen und dem tatsächlich gezeigten Verhalten tritt häufig in sportspezifischen Kontexten auf und wird meist auf eine Beeinträchtigung der Selbstkontrolle attribuiert. Dem liegt die traditionelle Sichtweise von Selbstkontrolle als einer limitierten Ressource zugrunde, deren Erschöpfung es in der Folge schwieriger macht, Hindernisse bei der Zielerreichung zu überwinden. In diesem Kapitel stellen wir dieser Perspektive aktuelle Ansätze gegenüber, die Selbstkontrolle als eine motivierte Kosten-Nutzen-Abwägung konzipieren und damit den Fokus auf die Bereitschaft legen, Selbstkontrolle auszuüben. Am Beispiel von Langeweile und Handlungskrisen illustrieren wir, wie sich die Kosten und Nutzen von Selbstkontrolle während der Erreichung sportlicher Ziele verändern können. Einerseits kann das Empfinden von Langeweile oder das Erleben einer Krise den Fokus auf alternative, potenziell lohnenswertere Ziele lenken, wodurch der Wert der aktuellen Zielerreichung und damit der Nutzen von Selbstkontrolle sinkt. Gleichzeitig handelt es sich bei Langeweile und Krisen um aversive Zustände, deren Regulation Anstrengung erfordert und die so die Kosten von Selbstkontrolle erhöhen können. Abschließend widmen wir uns der Frage, wie Menschen mit Langeweile und Krisen im Sport umgehen und welche Strategien dabei helfen können, die Bereitschaft zur Ausübung von Selbstkontrolle im Sport aufrechtzuerhalten. \n\n\n\n\n\n2024\n\n\nMaik Bieleke, Lucas Keller, Chris Englert\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the virtues of fragile self-control: Boredom as a catalyst for adaptive behavior regulation\n\n\nHandbook of Boredom\n\n\n\nbook chapter\n\n\n\nSelf-control is a fragile mechanism by design, and there is an ongoing debate about the reasons for this fragility. A mechanistically plausible perspective is offered by reward-based models of self-control such as the expected value of control (EVC) theory. According to the EVC theory, the allocation of self-control requires effort, which serves as a dynamic signal that quantifies the costs of self-control. People thus use self-control sparingly and continuously adjust its allocation such that its expected value remains optimal. Boredom affects this process in two ways: It lowers the value of a focal activity compared to alternative activities and renders the maintenance of the focal activity more costly by increasing the required effort. Consequently, less control is allocated to an activity as it becomes boring, which in turn permits an optimal balance between goal-directed behavior (exploitation, directed exploration) and undirected exploration. The essential conclusion from the EVC perspective is that self-control must be fragile to be an adaptive function for behavior regulation. Conceiving self-control as a reward-based choice also helps to address some key open questions in the literature on boredom and self-control, such as the adequate conceptualization of trait boredom and the replicability of ego depletion effects. \n\n\n\n\n\n2024\n\n\nMaik Bieleke, Wanja Wolff, Alex Bertrams\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoredom is not boring\n\n\nHandbook of Boredom\n\n\n\nbook chapter\n\n\n\nThat boredom is not boring is a long-established insight among many of the greatest thinkers in history. This is also reflected in a steadily increasing number of researchers who turn their attention to boredom across scientific disciplines. Their various insights and perspectives are the foundations of this book, to which the present chapter provides a brief introduction and overview. \n\n\n\n\n\n2024\n\n\nMaik Bieleke, Wanja Wolff, Corinna S.

However, less is known about emotions experienced by adolescents in the context of civic education. Applying the control-value theory to a cross-curricular context, we analyze the relations between two types of emotions experienced in civic education and their antecedents and effects on learning: achievement emotions experienced during in-class political discussions and epistemic emotions experienced during individual processing of political information in school. We hypothesized both types of emotions relate to control and value appraisal antecedents (e.g., internal political efficacy, personal importance). Further, we expected—depending on the specific emotion—positive or negative relations with academic outcomes (e.g., motivation, engagement, and knowledge). Data were collected with an online questionnaire in Austrian upper secondary schools with students (N = 594, Mage = 17.1) from grades 10 to 13. Bivariate latent correlations broadly support the expectations: We found mainly positive associations of antecedents and outcomes to enjoyment, hope, pride, curiosity, and surprise and negative associations to hopelessness, confusion, and boredom, but more complex correlation patterns for anxiety, anger, and shame. The results provide first insights into which emotions are experienced during political learning and underscore the importance of acknowledging the role of emotions in civic education. \n\n\n\n\n\n2024\n\n\nElisabeth Graf, Thomas Goetz, Maik Bieleke, Dana Murano\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInner obstacles and goal-directed behaviors of elite and youth level cyclists: A qualitative analysis from the perspective of athletes and coaches\n\n\n\n\n\n\njournal article\n\n\noriginal research\n\n\n\n Journal of Applied Sport and Exercise Psychology\n\n\n\n\n\n2024\n\n\nAnna Hirsch, Maik Bieleke, Julia Schüler, Wanja Wolff\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssessing and exploring self-enacted behavior change techniques: Frequency, structure, and relevance for physical activity and healthy eating\n\n\nCurrent Psychology\n\n\n\njournal article\n\n\noriginal research\n\n\n\nSelf-enactable behavior change techniques (Knittle et al., 2020), are active components of interventions that individuals can also employ on their own. The study explored the frequency of self-enactable behavior change techniques (SE-BCTs) usage, their psychometric structure, and their association with physical activity and healthy nutrition. To evaluate SE-BCTs, Abraham & Michie’s (2008) 26-BCT taxonomy was translated into a SE-BCT questionnaire and administered to 504 participants via a web survey. Participants reported self-enacted goals in physical activity (PA) and healthy nutrition (NUT), along with their importance, difficulty, and progress. Physical activity and healthy eating questionnaires served as indicators of successful behavior change. Using Bayesian statistics, we found variations in the usage intensity of SE-BCTs. Similarities and differences emerged between PA and NUT domains. For example, “time management” was commonly used in both, while “information seeking” was more prevalent in NUT. For some SE-BCTs, weak evidence emerged for gender differences and age effects. SE-BCTs formed clusters similar to BCTs, supported by Bayesian psychometric network analyses. Tests for potential preconditions and consequences of SE-BCTs revealed moderate-to-strong support for positive relations with goal importance, and strong support for positive relationships of SE-BCTs with behavior change. Moreover, PA was best predicted by a combination of the SE-BCTs “time management” plus “detailed plans,” whereas for NUT, a complex pattern of six SE-BCTs was the best-fitting predictive model. We discuss the potential of SE-BCTs for promoting physical activity and healthy eating add what is still needed to make them work efficiently. \n\n\n\n\n\n2024\n\n\nJulia Schüler, Maik Bieleke\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatent profiles of effort functions and their impact on task experience and behavior\n\n\nPsyArXiv\n\n\n\npreprint\n\n\noriginal research\n\n\n\nThe experience of effort is a decisive factor for engagement and behavior. However, exerting effort can yield vastly diverse experiences. We posit that these differences are due to distinct configurations of underlying effort functions (instrument, reward, adding value to an outcome) and are influenced by task context (entertaining/learning). Furthermore, we investigate how these profiles of effort functions affect the decision to exert further effort. In our online study, 471 participants (51 % female, 48 % male, Mage = 41.1 ± 11.9), received an instructional framing (entertainment/learning game) and reported their anticipated functions of effort regarding the upcoming task. Participants then had the opportunity to play Tetris. Given that successfully playing Tetris requires constant attention and a certain amount of exertion, and that it can be easily framed as either an entertainment or learning game, it serves as an appealing effort task for this study. Subsequently, participants indicated their task experience and their willingness to engage in further gameplay. A latent profile analysis identified four configurations of effort functions. These effort profiles significantly differed in the experience of positive affect, boredom, and perceived exertion in gaming, while no difference in negative affect was found. Interestingly, task framing did not moderate these effects. Yet, the effort profiles varied in their willingness to engage in further gameplay. Our findings underscore the critical role of effort’s functions in task experience and behavioral decisions. However, they might differ in their decisiveness in the decision to participate in effortful activities. \n\n\n\n\n\n2024\n\n\nJohanna Stähler, Wanja Wolff, Maik Bieleke, Julia Schüler\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTesting a novel task paradigm for inducing cognitive and physical effort\n\n\nOSF Registries\n\n\n\npreregistration\n\n\n\nPerforming motor tasks requires a combination of physical and cognitive effort. In this study, we test a novel pegboard task paradigm designed to induce varying levels of physical and cognitive demand. The task paradigm includes two types of blocks: one primarily physically demanding and the other primarily cognitively demanding. The specific demand levels are changed independently in each block. We aim to examine how the experience of physical and cognitive effort varies across different blocks and demand levels. We also investigate cognitive, affective, and motivational experiences associated with these tasks. Furthermore, we examine the relationship between these experiences with individual differences in valuing cognitive and physical effort. Lastly, we focus on how individual differences in processing speed and working memory capacity relate to performance in the cognitive block. \n\n\n\n\n\n2024\n\n\nJonathan Wientges, Julia Schüler, Maik Bieleke\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBug or feature? Boredom feels aversive, and this is why it matters\n\n\nIn-Mind\n\n\n\nmiscellaneous\n\n\n\nIn class, during exercise, at work: boredom is an everyday experience that is generally regarded as an annoying and rather useless nuisance. In keeping with this attested uselessness, boredom had not gathered much research interest for a long time. Fortunately, this has changed and new and exciting research paints a different picture of boredom, highlighting its function and its relevance for human behavior. Indeed, boredom appears to play a key role in goal-striving because it acts as a catalyst for change. Simply put, boredom tells us that we are wasting our resources and that we should look for other things to do. To provide an overview of the emerging research on boredom, this article covers what boredom is, when it occurs, what it does, and why it matters. \n\n\n\n\n\n2024\n\n\nMaik Bieleke, Katja Rewitz, Wanja Wolff\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the specifics of valuing effort: A developmental and a formalized perspective on preferences for mental and physical effort\n\n\nPeer Community Journal\n\n\n\njournal article\n\n\noriginal research\n\n\n\nPeer-reviewed and recommended by PCI Health & Movement Sciences, 10.24072/pci.healthmovsci.100041\n\n\n\n\n\n2024\n\n\nWanja Wolff, Johanna Stähler, Julia Schüler, Maik Bieleke\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverview of current directions in boredom research\n\n\nHandbook of Boredom\n\n\n\nbook chapter\n\n\n\nThe concluding chapter of this book represents a collaborative effort between the editors and all contributing authors, resulting in a comprehensive overview of the current directions in boredom research.

Although intuitive and widespread, this assumption lacks an empirical basis and a theoretical framework. We conducted a field experiment and randomly assigned 208 students to an easy-to-difficult or a difficult-to-easy condition in a mathematics test. Perceived challenge was measured along with control appraisals, value appraisals, and emotions (enjoyment, pride, anxiety, anger, boredom). While students starting with easy tasks felt less challenged than students starting with difficult tasks in Part 1, no differences emerged regarding control and value appraisals and emotions. In Part 2, students who had started with easy tasks proceeded to difficult tasks and reported a higher level of challenge, less value and control, and less positive and more negative emotions than students who proceeded from difficult-to-easy tasks. Control and value appraisals mediated the differences between the two conditions, especially regarding positive emotions. These results cast doubt on the preference for easy-to-difficult over difficult-to-easy task orders, revealing their potential for causing adverse experiences at the end of the test (e.g., reflecting contrast effects). \n\n\n\n\n\n2023\n\n\nMaik Bieleke, Thomas Goetz, Maike Krannich, Anna-Lena Roos, Takuya Yanagida\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeasuring emotions in mathematics: The Achievement Emotions Questionnaire—Mathematics (AEQ-M)\n\n\nZDM Mathematics Education\n\n\n\njournal article\n\n\nscale development\n\n\n\nUnderstanding the structure, antecedents, and outcomes of students’ emotions has become a topic of major interest in research on mathematics education. Much of this work is based on the Achievement Emotions Questionnaire—Mathematics (AEQ-M), a self-report instrument assessing students’ mathematics-related emotions. The AEQ-M measures seven emotions (enjoyment, pride, anger, anxiety, shame, hopelessness, boredom) across class, learning, and test contexts (internal structure). Based on control-value theory, it is assumed that these emotions are evoked by control and value appraisals, and that they influence students’ motivation, learning strategies, and performance (external relations). Despite the popularity and frequent use of the AEQ-M, the research leading to its development has never been published, creating uncertainty about the validity of the proposed internal structure and external relations. We close this gap in Study 1 (N = 781 students, Grades 5–10, mean age 14.1 years, 53.5% female) by demonstrating that emotions are organized across contexts and linked to their proposed antecedents and outcomes. Study 2 (N = 699 students, Grade 7 and 9, mean age 14.0 years, 56.9% female) addresses another deficit in research on the AEQ-M, the lack of evidence regarding the assumption that emotions represent sets of interrelated affective, cognitive, motivational, and physiological/expressive components. We close this gap by evaluating extended AEQ-M scales, systematically assessing these components for five core mathematics emotions (enjoyment, anger, anxiety, hopelessness, boredom). Our work provides solid grounds for future research using the AEQ-M to assess emotions and their components in the domain of mathematics. \n\n\n\n\n\n2023\n\n\nMaik Bieleke, Thomas Goetz, Takuya Yanagida, Elouise Botes, Anne C.

To maximize its effectiveness, it is paramount to investigate psychological factors that predict adherence to social distancing guidelines and examine corresponding interventions. We focused on individual differences in if-then planning, self-control, and boredom, and tested an intervention based on if-then planning. We conducted a two-wave longitudinal study combining observational and experimental methods. Participants (N = 574, 35.7% female, age: M = 37.5 years, SD = 10.8) reported their adherence to social distancing guidelines and the perceived difficulty of adherence at T1, along with trait measures of if-then planning, self-control, and boredom. Afterwards, they were randomly assigned to an if-then planning intervention to increase adherence, or to a control intervention. One week later at T2, participants again reported their adherence and the perceived difficulty of adhering. Multiple regression and structural equation modeling were used to establish whether trait if-then planning, self-control, and boredom predicted adherence, and to examine the effects of the if-then planning intervention. Trait if-then planning, self-control, and boredom were associated with T1 adherence, while only if-then planning and boredom predicted T2 adherence. No overall treatment effect of the if-then planning intervention emerged; however, participants who complied with the intervention (75.6%) maintained higher levels of adherence over time than control participants. In sum, individual differences in if-then planning, self-control, and boredom predicted adherence to social distancing guidelines. If-then planning interventions are promising but require further steps to ascertain compliance. \n\n\n\n\n\n2023\n\n\nMaik Bieleke, Corinna S.

This question will be addressed by an innovative study by Lally et al. (2010), in which they tracked the subjective automaticity of a novel, daily (eating or exercise-related) routine, using the Self-Report Habit Index. They showed that the gradual automatization of a novel routine is best described by an asymptotic curve, and that it takes (a median of) 66 days to reach the asymptotic ‘habit plateau’, with a range of 18 to 254 days (based on statistical extrapolation). However, these findings were based on a small sample of 39 participants, and this influential study has not been replicated yet.

Based on the control-value theory of achievement emotions, we hypothesized that students may experience significant levels of boredom during testing (“test boredom”; Hypothesis 1) and that test boredom may be significantly related to theoretically hypothesized antecedents (control and value appraisals; Hypothesis 2) and outcomes (performance; Hypothesis 3). We further hypothesized that test boredom was more detrimental when students felt overchallenged during the test than when they felt underchallenged (“abundance hypothesis”; Hypothesis 4). We tested these hypotheses in two studies (Study 1: N = 208 eighth graders; 54% female; Study 2: N = 1,612 fifth to 10th graders, 47% female) using both trait and state measures of test boredom in mathematics and their proposed antecedents and outcomes. In support of Hypothesis 1, participants reported statistically significant levels of boredom during tests. Furthermore, the relations of test boredom with its control and value antecedents (i.e., being over- or underchallenged, facets of value) were in line with our assumptions (Hypothesis 2). In support of Hypothesis 3, test boredom was significantly negatively related to academic achievement (grades). In line with Hypothesis 4, test scores were negatively related to boredom due to being overchallenged but unrelated, or even positively related, to boredom due to being underchallenged. Directions for future research on test boredom as well as practical implications are outlined. \n\n\n\n\n\n2023\n\n\nThomas Goetz, Maik Bieleke, Takuya Yanagida, Maike Krannich, Anna-Lena Roos, Anne C.

Investigating the interactive role of engagement and value as predictors of boredom in athletic training\n\n\nSport, Exercise, and Performance Psychology\n\n\n\njournal article\n\n\noriginal research\n\n\n\nRecent research has identified boredom as a guiding signal in goal-directed behavior. As boredom activates a search for more valuable activities, it can consequently challenge goal-directed behavior; this is also expected to be the case in the sporting context. Here, we examined the experience of boredom in athletic training for a competition among 153 athletes with a cross-sectional questionnaire. We developed the questionnaire based on theoretical approaches to boredom. Specifically, we considered two core triggers of boredom (i.e., the ability to remain engaged with the training and the value that athletes ascribe to the training). We found that the positive relationship between the difficulty of engagement in athletic training and the experience of boredom was moderated by the value ascribed to the training. In other words, it seems that the value ascribed to the training can play a protective role, in that high levels of value nullify the positive relationship between difficulty of engagement and boredom experienced in sports. Future research is needed to better understand the antecedents and consequences of boredom experiences in specific sporting contexts, which could be achieved, for example, by differentiating between individual and collective activities or competitions and training situations. \n\n\n\n\n\n2023\n\n\nCorinna S.

This study investigated the role of different test anxiety components (affective, cognitive, motivational and physiological) as mediators between control and performance as proposed by Pekrun’s control-value theory (CVT). While all components were assessed via self-report, the physiological component was additionally assessed via electrodermal activity (EDA). Aims. We examined the relative impact of the self-reported anxiety components and EDA in this mediating mechanism to identify the most relevant assessment(s) (i.e., self-reported anxiety components and/or EDA) for predicting test performance. Sample. The study comprised 50 eighth graders. Methods. Data were collected during a mathematics test comprising six task blocks. State self-reports of control and anxiety components along with test performance and other test emotions were collected block-wise (i.e., repeated assessments within students). EDA was continuously recorded. Results. Consistent with CVT, intra-individual mediation analysis with multiple mediators revealed that higher control predicted lower anxiety (i.e., all self-reported components). Unexpectedly, higher control was associated with increased EDA. Follow-up analyses taking other test emotions into account suggested this might reflect positive activation. Correlations between EDA and control and self-reported anxiety components differed depending on which test emotion was dominant in each situation. Regarding test performance, only the cognitive component was a significant mediator and thus seems to play a pivotal role in the relationship between control and performance. Conclusions. Distinguishing between anxiety components and including unbiased physiological measures improve our understanding of the mechanisms behind the relationship between test anxiety and performance. Higher physiological arousal may be a sign of anxiety but can also be a sign of positive activation. When aiming to reduce negative effects of anxiety on performance, targeting the cognitive component seems crucial. Implications of these findings for educational and psychological practice are discussed. \n\n\n\n\n\n2023\n\n\nAnna-Lena Roos, Thomas Goetz, Maike Krannich, Monika Donker, Maik Bieleke, Anna Caltabiano, Tim Mainhard\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoredom, performance & health\n\n\n\n\n\n\njournal article\n\n\neditorial\n\n\n\n Performance Enhancement & Health\n\n\n\n\n\n2023\n\n\nWanja Wolff, Maik Bieleke, Corinna S.

Unfortunately, existing interventions aiming at the promotion of physical activity seem incapable of stopping or reversing this trend. In the ProPELL research project, we therefore adopt a novel multidisciplinary and multimethodological approach to promote physical activity with a dedicated focus on physical exercise. In a 21-week randomized controlled trial (RCT) study, participants in the experimental group receive an eight-week lab-based jump training, while participants in the control group receive no training. This is followed by an eight-week observation of physical activity and exercise behavior in both groups. Various physiological (e.g., cardiovascular, neuromuscular, and endocrine) and psychological (e.g., motivational, emotional, and behavioral) parameters are measured in both conditions at three time points: at baseline, after the intervention, and after the follow-up. This will be complemented by continuous measurements of exercise- and activity-related variables (e.g., physical activity, heart rate). The analyses will focus on changes and dynamic interactions of the assessed parameters during the intervention and the follow-up period, for instance, by capitalizing on visual data analytics. \n\n\n\n\n\n2022\n\n\nMaik Bieleke, Ursula Fischer, Markus Gruber, Martina Kanning, Daniel Keim, Daniela Mier, Jens Pruessner, Julia Schüler\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoredom is the root of all evil — or is it? A psychometric network approach to individual differences in behavioral responses to boredom\n\n\nRoyal Society Open Science\n\n\n\njournal article\n\n\noriginal research\n\n\nscale development\n\n\n\nFunctional accounts of boredom propose that boredom serves as an impartial signal to change something about the current situation, which should give rise to adaptive and maladaptive behaviour alike. This seemingly contrasts with research on boredom proneness, which has overwhelmingly shown associations with maladaptive behaviour. To shed light on this discrepancy, we disentangled boredom proneness from individual differences in (i) the urge to avoid and escape boredom and (ii) adaptive and maladaptive ways of dealing with boredom by developing corresponding trait scales. In a study with N = 636 participants, psychometric network modelling revealed tight associations between boredom proneness and less adaptive and (especially) more maladaptive ways of dealing with boredom. However, its associations with the urge to avoid and escape boredom were rather weak. Importantly, a higher urge to avoid and escape boredom was linked not only to more maladaptive but also to more adaptive ways of dealing with boredom. This pattern of results was robust across various specific behaviours that have previously been linked to boredom. Our findings provide novel evidence for functional accounts of boredom from an individual difference perspective, cautioning against a shallow view of boredom as being associated with purely maladaptive behaviour. \n\n\n\n\n\n2022\n\n\nMaik Bieleke, Leonie Ripper, Julia Schüler, Wanja Wolff\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe agonizing effects of uncertainty: Effects of announced vs. unannounced performance assessments on emotions and achievement\n\n\nPLoS ONE\n\n\n\njournal article\n\n\noriginal research\n\n\n\nPerformance assessments play an essential role in performance diagnostics at schools. In practice, both announced and unannounced assessments are regularly used. However, it is unclear whether assessments are better administered announced or unannounced. From a theoretical perspective, it can be argued that announced assessments, mediated by the greater degree of students’ subjective control that accompanies them, should have a more beneficial effect on emotions, as well as the subsequently resulting performance, than unannounced assessments. To investigate these assumptions, emotion (enjoyment, anxiety) and achievement data (grades) were collected from 414 students in 19 lower- and upper-level tracks at a German secondary school on both announced and unannounced performance assessments. Less anxiety and more enjoyment occurred on the announced assessments. Moreover, enjoyment and anxiety were predictors of performance (i.e., school grades), which was better overall on announced assessments than on unannounced ones. The results of our field study suggest that announced assessments have more beneficial effects on emotions than unannounced assessments. \n\n\n\n\n\n2022\n\n\nMaik Bieleke, Jean-Marie Schwarzkopf, Thomas Goetz, Ludwig Haag\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting trapped in a dead end?

Whether this reflects the depletion of a global self-control resource is subject to an ongoing debate. We turned to boredom as a potential confounding variable to advance this debate. In a high-powered experiment (N = 719), participants worked on a primary (transcription) task of varying self-control demands (low, high) and length (2, 4, 8 min), followed by a secondary (Stroop) task with low and high self-control demanding trials. In addition to trait boredom, we measured effort, difficulty, tiredness, frustration, and boredom after the primary task and repeatedly during the secondary task. Effort, difficulty, tiredness, and frustration increased with the demand and duration of the primary task; however, without affecting performance in the secondary task. Importantly, participants rated both the primary and the secondary task as boring, and higher boredom at the state and the trait level was associated with lower effort and higher difficulty, tiredness, and frustration. During the secondary task, boredom increased steadily but was generally lower in more self-control demanding trials. Finally, boredom predicted performance in the secondary task. These results show an intricate relationship between self-control and boredom that research on these two constructs should carefully disentangle. \n\n\n\n\n\n2021\n\n\nMaik Bieleke, Leon Barton, Wanja Wolff\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe AEQ-S: A short version of the Achievement Emotions Questionnaire\n\n\nContemporary Educational Psychology\n\n\n\njournal article\n\n\nscale development\n\n\n\nThe Achievement Emotions Questionnaire (AEQ) is a well-established instrument for measuring achievement emotions in educational research and beyond. Its popularity rests on the coverage of the component structure of various achievement emotions across different academic settings. However, this broad conceptual scope requires the administration of 6 to 12 items per scale (Mdn = 10), which limits the applicability of the AEQ in empirical studies that necessitate brief administration times. We therefore developed the AEQ-S, a short version of the AEQ, with only 4 items per scale that nevertheless maintain the conceptual scope of the instrument. We validated the AEQ-S based on a reanalysis of Pekrun, Goetz, Frenzel, Barchfeld, and Perry’s (2011) dataset (N = 389 university students) and by administering them to a new and independent validation sample (N = 471 university students). Despite their brevity, the AEQ-S scales achieved satisfactory reliability and correlated substantially with the original AEQ scales. Moreover, structural relationships and intercorrelations between the scales and their relations with external measures of antecedents and outcomes of achievement emotions were highly similar for the AEQ-S and AEQ scales. These findings suggest that the AEQ-S is a suitable substitute for the AEQ when administration time is limited. \n\n\n\n\n\n2021\n\n\nMaik Bieleke, Katarzyna Gogol, Thomas Goetz, Lia Daniels, Reinhard Pekrun\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndividual differences in if-then planning: Insights from the development and application of the If-Then Planning Scale (ITPS)\n\n\nPersonality and Individual Differences\n\n\n\njournal article\n\n\nscale development\n\n\n\nMaking if-then plans is a self-regulation strategy that facilitates goal attainment. An open question is, however, whether there are individual differences in if-then planning. We, therefore, developed and validated the If-Then Planning Scale (ITPS) in three independent studies with more than 2600 participants. The ITPS is conceptually grounded in implementation intention theory, measuring whether individuals identify critical situations (if-part) and plan goal-directed behaviors (then-part) in terms of opportunities and obstacles. We established the psychometric qualities of the ITPS in Studies 1a and 1b and its convergent and discriminant validity in Studies 2 and 3. Applying the ITPS, we showed that if-then planning is associated with the attainment of environmental goals (Studies 1a and 1b), socioeconomic status (Studies 1a, 1b, and 2), and academic achievement (Study 3). Our results demonstrate individual differences in if-then planning that can be efficiently and reliably measured with the ITPS, and reveal systematic associations between these individual differences and goal attainment. \n\n\n\n\n\n2021\n\n\nMaik Bieleke, Lucas Keller\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf-then planning\n\n\nEuropean Review of Social Psychology\n\n\n\njournal article\n\n\nliterature review\n\n\n\nThe self-regulation strategy of forming implementation intentions has now been studied for almost 30 years.

Next, we turn to novel applications focusing on how implementation intentions affect physical endurance and promote strategic information processing. Our review concludes with an outlook on future research on implementation intentions that covers emerging individual difference perspectives, innovative approaches to characterize underlying cognitive processes, and the prospects of integrating insights from related fields of research. As such, our review is an empathic call for addressing the many intriguing conceptual and empirical questions that still revolve around implementation intentions. \n\n\n\n\n\n2021\n\n\nMaik Bieleke, Lucas Keller, Peter M.

A critical requirement for maintaining performance at a high level is that individuals continuously self-regulate various affective experiences (e.g., pain or boredom), thoughts (e.g., related to distractions or quitting), and behaviors (e.g., responding to feedback or increasing effort). The ubiquitous importance of self-regulation for performance has been recognized across psychological disciplines.

We hypothesized reciprocal associations between student-teacher relationship quality (i.e., interpersonal closeness) and students’ emotions in the classroom (i.e., enjoyment, pride, anxiety, anger, boredom, and shame). Data from a two-wave longitudinal study with annual assessments in grade 10 (Time 1) and 11 (Time 2) were used to test this hypothesis (N = 535; mean age at Time 1: 16.7 years, SD = 0.6). Student-perceived relationship quality and students’ emotions were assessed in the academic domains of mathematics, German, English, and French. In line with our hypothesis, cross-lagged panel models showed reciprocal associations: Higher relationship quality was associated with stronger positive emotions and weaker negative emotions over time. In turn, lower negative emotions and higher positive emotions were associated with higher relationship quality. The association between initial emotions and student-teacher relationship quality one year later was stronger than the reverse association. Further, the links between relationship quality and emotions were largely equivalent across school domains but differed in strength across emotions.

Are standard behavioral risk measures able to capture this? To answer this question, we assessed self-reports of risk taking and measured the risk-taking behavior of samples of snowboarders and climbers. Two groups of non-athletes, university students and crowdworkers, and athletes of a sport that does not include the potential of grave injury or death, esports athletes, serve as control conditions and complement our study. Across these five different groups, 1313 participants performed an online version of the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART) and gave self-reports of general willingness to take risks and sports-specific risk taking. Extreme sports athletes exhibited greater risk taking in the BART than non-athletes and esports athletes. Furthermore, BART-performance predicted sports-specific risk taking and its affective consequences. Our results speak to the BART’s ecological validity and the unique role of physical consequences on risk-taking behavior. \n\n\n\n\n\n2021\n\n\nLucas Keller, Maik Bieleke, Wanja Wolff\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverclaiming is related to confidence but not to dark triad personality traits or stated and revealed risk preferences\n\n\nPLoS ONE\n\n\n\njournal article\n\n\noriginal research\n\n\n\nThe tendency to be overly confident in one’s future and skills has long been studied. More recently, a correlate of this overconfidence, the tendency to overclaim knowledge, has been in the focus of research. Its antecedents and downstream behavioral consequences are still in question. In a sample of undergraduate students (N = 168), we tested whether a set of characteristics of the person (e.g., age, gender) and personality traits (i.e., the Dark Triad) is related to overclaiming knowledge. Moreover, we investigated whether overclaiming, in turn, predicts risk preferences. To this end, we asked individuals to rate their confidence in solving a set of different math problems and their familiarity with a set of math concepts. Some of these concepts were nonexistent, thereby allowing participants to overclaim knowledge. Participants then stated their general risk preference and performed three tasks revealing their general, financial, and social risk preferences. We demonstrated the hypothesized relationship between overclaiming and confidence. Furthermore, we observed that the assessed characteristics of the person were not correlated with overclaiming. If anything, height and digit ratio, a phenomenological correlate of hormonal differences during development, tended to be associated with overclaiming. Surprisingly, overclaiming was not at all related to risk preferences or personality traits. This set of results shows the need for relevant theoretical and methodological refinements.\n\n\n\n\n\n2021\n\n\nLucas Keller, Kim-Marie Koppe, Peter M.

In several countries, homeschooling has been introduced to replace classroom schooling. With a focus on individual differences, the present study examined 138 schoolers (age range = 6 to 21 years) regarding their self-control and boredom proneness. The results showed that both traits were important in predicting adherence to homeschooling. Schoolers with higher levels of self-control perceived homeschooling as less difficult, which in turn increased homeschooling adherence. In contrast, schoolers with higher levels of boredom proneness perceived homeschooling as more difficult, which in turn reduced homeschooling adherence. These results partially hold when it comes to studying in the classroom. However, boredom threatened adherence only in the homeschooling context. Our results indicate that boredom proneness is a critical construct to consider when educational systems switch to homeschooling during a pandemic. \n\n\n\n\n\n2021\n\n\nCorinna S.

A cost-value approach to pandemic boredom\n\n\nHumanities and Social Sciences Communications\n\n\n\njournal article\n\n\noriginal research\n\n\n\nIn an effort to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, countries around the world have employed non-pharmaceutical containment measures. The effectiveness of such mitigation efforts relies on individual compliance (e.g., avoiding to travel or to gather). Crucially, adhering to the required behavioral recommendations places substantial burdens on those who are asked to follow them. One particularly likely outcome of adherence should be the experience of boredom. Thus, people might get bored by bothering. Drawing from research and theorizing on reward-based decision making, we conducted a high-powered study (N = 1553 US participants) to investigate whether the value and effort people ascribe to adherence to containment measures directly and indirectly (i.e., mediated by adherence) affects their experience of boredom. As expected, structural equation modeling revealed that high value and low effort predicted compliance with behavioral recommendations. Moreover, higher compliance was linked to more boredom, meaning that high value and low effort increased boredom via compliance. In contrast, high value and low effort had direct effects on boredom in the opposite direction (i.e., decreasing boredom). Attesting to their robustness and generalizability, these findings held for both prospective (with respect to upcoming winter holidays) and retrospective behavior (with respect to previous thanksgiving holidays), across US states, which had or had not enforced behavioral restrictions, individual differences in boredom proneness, and demographic variables. Taken together, our results provide evidence that people can indeed get bored by bothering: Complying with nonpharmacological containment measures like avoiding to travel and to gather can come at the cost of getting bored, an experience that was strongly linked to negative affect in our study. \n\n\n\n\n\n2021\n\n\nCorinna S.

In contrast to this perspective, the current article’s aim is to draw attention to potential issues with making inferences about mechanisms of deliberation based on characteristics of the observed decision outcomes. We propose that a consequence of deliberation is to simply reduce the likelihood of expressing immediately available (dominant) responses. We illustrate how this consequence of deliberation can provide a parsimonious explanation for a broad range of prior research on decision-making. Furthermore, we discuss how the present perspective on deliberation relates to the question of how the cognitive system implements nondominant responses based on associative learning and affective prioritization rather than voluntary decisions. Beyond the present article’s theoretical focus, for illustrative purposes, we provide some empirical evidence (three studies, N = 175) that is in line with our proposal. In sum, our theoretical framework, prior empirical evidence, and the present studies suggest that deliberation reduces the likelihood of expressing dominant responses. Although we do not argue that this is the only consequence or mechanism regarding deliberation, we aim to highlight that it is worthwhile considering this minimal consequence of deliberation as compared with certain higher cognitive functions in the interpretation of deliberation outcomes. \n\n\n\n\n\n2021\n\n\nTorsten Martiny-Huenger, Maik Bieleke, Johannes Doerflinger, Matthew B.

However, failed replications have cast doubt on the existence of this so-called ego depletion effect. Here, we investigated between-task (i.e., variation in self-control tasks) and within-task variation (i.e., task duration) as possible explanations for the conflicting literature on ego depletion effects. In a high-powered experiment (N = 709 participants), we used two established self-control tasks (Stroop task, transcription task) to test how variations in the duration of primary and secondary self-control tasks (2, 4, 8, or 16 min per task) affect the occurrence of an ego depletion effect (i.e., impaired performance in the secondary task). In line with the ego depletion hypothesis, subjects perceived longer lasting secondary tasks as more self-control demanding. Contrary to the ego depletion hypothesis, however, performance did neither suffer from prior self-control exertion, nor as a function of task duration. If anything, performance tended to improve when the primary self-control task lasted longer. These effects did not differ between the two self-control tasks, suggesting that the observed null findings were independent of task type. \n\n\n\n\n\n2021\n\n\nWanja Wolff, Vanda Sieber, Maik Bieleke, Chris Englert\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEffects of social value orientation (SVO) and decision mode on controlled information acquisition - A Mouselab perspective\n\n\nJournal of Experimental Social Psychology\n\n\n\njournal article\n\n\noriginal research\n\n\n\nInsights into the processes underlying observed decisions are crucial for a comprehensive understanding of behavior.

In two experiments, participants worked on two consecutive SVO tasks, in which they allocated points between themselves and others. Information regarding the available distributions of points had to be actively acquired by moving the mouse cursor over corresponding boxes on the screen. We observed a stable relationship between SVO and controlled information acquisition in both experiments: less selfish participants acquired more information and made more other-oriented acquisitions, and this relationship showed up in both an intuitive and a reflective decision mode. However, participants in a reflective decision mode acquired more information, their acquisitions were more strongly other-oriented, and their decisions were more prosocial compared to participants in an intuitive mode. Taken together, our results advance research on SVO by showing that non-selfish individuals invest considerable time and effort to gauge the consequences of their decisions for others, which might underlie the pervasive effects of SVO on many socially relevant behaviors. Moreover, we demonstrate how intuitive versus reflective decision modes can alter controlled information acquisition. Finally, our results illustrate that Mouselab is a simple-to-use and versatile tool for tracing cognitive processes underlying social psychological phenomena. \n\n\n\n\n\n2020\n\n\nMaik Bieleke, David Dohmen, Peter M.

However, its effectiveness hinges on adherence by individuals who face substantial burdens from the required behavioral restrictions. Here, we investigate sources of individual variation in adhering to social distancing guidelines. In a high-powered study (N = 895), we tested direct and indirect effects of boredom and self-control on adherence. The results showed that both traits were important predictors of adherence but the underlying mechanisms differed. Specifically, individuals high in boredom perceived social distancing as more difficult, which in turn reduced their adherence (i.e., a mediated effect). In contrast, individuals high in self-control adhered more to the guidelines without perceiving them as more or less difficult; however, self-control moderated the effect of difficulty on adherence. Our results are immediately relevant to improve the efficacy of social distancing guidelines in the COVID-19 response. \n\n\n\n\n\n2020\n\n\nWanja Wolff, Corinna S.

A pilot field study on the effects of conveying self-control strategies on volleyball service performance\n\n\nBehavioral Sciences\n\n\n\njournal article\n\n\noriginal research\n\n\n\nVolleyball serves constitute an important example for a self-controlled sequence of actions in sports that is difficult to improve. It is therefore paramount to investigate whether and how conveying self-control strategies to athletes affects their service performance. To address this question, we conducted a pilot field study with sixty-two players from four Swiss volleyball schools. They performed a warm-up and subsequently a first series of 15 serves. Objective service performance was measured in terms of errors, velocity, and precision. Afterwards, players formulated either individual goals (goal condition) or plans (plan condition) based on their coaches’ correction instructions. In a second series of 15 serves objective performance was worse in some respects compared to the first series (i.e., more errors in the plan condition, reduced precision in both conditions). Mixed-effects analyses of performance development across conditions in the second series showed initially reduced but steadily recouping precision and velocity, while the number of errors stayed constant. In contrast to the objective performance, coaches evaluated their players’ service performance during the second series of serves as substantially better than during the first series. Taken together, the results of this pilot field study suggest that conveying either goals or plans as self-control strategies may involve initial adjustment costs followed by a subsequent recovery period. \n\n\n\n\n\n2019\n\n\nMaik Bieleke, Claudio Kriech, Wanja Wolff\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMindset theory of action phases and if-then planning\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbook chapter\n\n\n\n Social Psychology in Action\n\n\n\n\n\n2019\n\n\nLucas Keller, Maik Bieleke, Peter M.

Yet, little is known about the consequences of forming implementation intentions for goal attainment in situations that were not specified in the if-then plan. In three experiments, we assessed goal attainment in terms of speed and accuracy in an object classification task, focusing on situations that were similar or dissimilar to critical situations and required planned or different responses. The results of Experiments 1 and 3 provide evidence for a facilitation of planned responses in critical and in sufficiently similar situations, enhancing goal attainment when the planned response was required and impairing it otherwise. In Experiment 3, additional unfavorable effects however emerged in situations that were dissimilar to the critical one but required the planned response as well. We discuss theoretical implications as well as potential benefits and pitfalls emerging from these non-planned effects of forming implementation intentions. \n\n\n\n\n\n2018\n\n\nMaik Bieleke, Eve Legrand, Astrid Mignon, Peter M.

Two studies tested the idea that mental contrasting with implementation intentions (MCII) interventions would be effective in down-regulating anger. In Study 1, participants who adopted the self-regulation strategy of MCII showed significantly less anger-related negative affect after the anger induction than participants in a control condition, with positive affect staying unaffected. Results from a second study with a control condition plus three self-regulation conditions – a reappraisal, a MCII, and a reappraisal + MCII condition – suggest that participants using MCII were effective in down-regulating anger, irrespective of whether it was supplemented by reappraisal or not. The present research contributes to emotion regulation research by introducing MCII as an effective strategy that can be tailored to satisfy individual emotion regulation demands, such as dealing with experienced anger. \n\n\n\n\n\n2018\n\n\nInge Schweiger Gallo, Maik Bieleke, Migual A.

We measured SVO one week prior to an ultimatum game experiment in which participants had to accept or reject a series of 10 ultimatum offers including very low (unfair) ones. Before making these decisions, participants mentally contrasted their individual goals with the obstacle of pondering at length or acting in a hasty way; then they made the plan to adopt an intuitive or a reflective mode of processing (intuitive and reflective condition, respectively), or made no such plans (control condition). Participants with rather high (prosocial) SVO scores were more likely to accept unfair offers in the reflective than the intuitive condition. This effect also evinced for a subset of selfish individuals; however, the majority with rather low (selfish) scores made similar decisions in both conditions. This pattern of results suggests that SVO moderates the effects of intuitive versus reflective modes of processing on responses to low ultimatum offers. \n\n\n\n\n\n2017\n\n\nMaik Bieleke, Peter M.

According to the psychobiological model of endurance, RPE is a central limiting factor in performance. While RPE is known to be affected by psychological manipulations, it remains to be examined whether RPE can be self-regulated during static muscular endurance exercises to enhance performance. In this experiment, we investigate the effectiveness of the widely used and recommended self-regulation strategy of if-then planning (i.e., implementation intentions) in down-regulating RPE and improving performance in a static muscular endurance task. 62 female students (age: M = 23.7 years, SD = 4.0) were randomly assigned to an implementation intention or a control condition and performed a static muscular endurance task. They held two intertwined rings as long as possible while avoiding contacts between the rings. In the implementation intention condition, participants had an if-then plan: “If the task becomes too strenuous for me, then I ignore the strain and tell myself: Keep going!” Every 25 ± 10 s participants reported their RPE along with their perceived pain. Endurance performance was measured as time to failure, along with contact errors as a measure of performance quality. No differences emerged between implementation intention and control participants regarding time to failure and performance quality. However, mixed-effects model analyses revealed a significant Time-to-Failure × Condition interaction for RPE. Compared to the control condition, participants in the implementation intention condition reported substantially greater increases in RPE during the second half of the task and reached higher total values of RPE before task termination. A similar but weaker pattern evinced for perceived pain. Our results demonstrate that RPE during an endurance task can be self-regulated with if-then plans. This finding is particularly important given how frequently RPE is used in exercise science as a correlate of physiological processes that ultimately limit performance. Unexpectedly, participants with implementation intentions reported higher RPE than control participants. This suggests that strategies to self-regulate RPE might have ironic effects that hamper performance, maybe by increasing attention to RPE. This implication is important for exercise physiologists, athletes and coaches. \n\n\n\n\n\n2017\n\n\nMaik Bieleke, Wanja Wolff\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNothing will stop me? Flexibly tenacious goal striving with implementation intentions\n\n\nMotivation Science\n\n\n\njournal article\n\n\noriginal research\n\n\n\nImplementation intentions (if-then plans) help people to automatically perform goal-directed behaviors when they encounter goal-relevant critical situations. Besides the intended beneficial effects on goal attainment, however, goal-directed behaviors might entail various costs. Successful goal striving then requires flexible tenacity: tenaciously holding on to behaviors that inflict bearable costs but flexibly backing off from performing excessively costly behaviors. In the present research, we investigated whether goal striving with implementation intentions is characterized by such flexible tenacity. In Experiments 1 and 2, implementation intention participants held on to goal-directed behaviors that inflicted bearable costs (sustaining unpleasant noise and annoying effort), whereas participants with mere goal intentions reduced their performance of goal-directed behaviors. In Experiment 3, both goal and implementation intention participants backed off from performing an excessively costly behavior (involving monetary loss). This effect was more pronounced among implementation intention participants, who additionally lowered their goal commitment. We conclude that implementation intentions render goal striving tenaciously flexible, facilitating goal-directed behaviors unless this is associated with excessive costs. \n\n\n\n\n\n2017\n\n\nEve Legrand, Maik Bieleke, Peter M.

Typically, response times are slower if participants can choose between several alternatives (free-choice) compared to when a stimulus determines a single correct response (forced-choice). This performance difference is commonly attributed to additional cognitive processing in free-choice tasks, which require time-consuming decisions between response options. Alternatively, the forced-choice advantage might result from facilitated perceptual processing, a prediction derived from the framework of implementation intentions. This hypothesis was tested in three experiments. Experiments 1 and 2 were PRP experiments and showed the expected underadditive interaction of the SOA manipulation and task type, pointing to a pre-central perceptual origin of the performance difference. Using the additive-factors logic, Experiment 3 further supported this view. We discuss the findings in the light of alternative accounts and offer potential mechanisms underlying performance differences in forced- and free-choice tasks. \n\n\n\n\n\n2015\n\n\nMarkus Janczyk, Michael Dambacher, Maik Bieleke, Peter M.

    "text": "Background\nThe Achievement Emotions Questionnaire (AEQ) is a well-established and widely used instrument for measuring achievement emotions. It covers the component structure of various emotions across three diffent academic settings. However, this breadth requires a total of 232 items distributed across 24 scales, making the AEQ difficult to use when administration time is limited. The AEQ-S addresses this issue by reducing the number of items to 96 (i.e., 4 items per scale), allowing much more economic assessments. Despite its brevity, the AEQ-S is a reliable instrument that maintains the AEQ’s conceptual scope and reproduces its structural relationships (e.g., with external criteria). This makes the AEQ-S a valuable instrument when administration time or space are limited.\nThe internal structure of the AEQ-S is identical to the AEQ, as it uses a subset of items from all AEQ sections and scales. Accordingly, the AEQ-S is organized in three sections: class-related emotions, learning-related emotions, and test-related emotions. Each section consists of eight scales, and each scale comprises four items pertaining to an individual achievement emotion. The AEQ-S maintains the component structure of the AEQ as well. Each scale measures the affective, cognitive, motivational, and physiological component of the corresponding achievement emotion with one item each (except the physiological component of hope, for which no items exist in the AEQ)."
