The AEQ-S addresses this issue by reducing the number of items to 96 (i.e., 4 items per scale), allowing much more economic assessments.

Participants rate each of the eight items on a 5-point Likert scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree).\n\n\nInstruction\nThe instructions used for the AEQ-S focus on general emotional experiences across subjects (i.e., traits).
