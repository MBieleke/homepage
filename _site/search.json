This neglect is perplexing, especially considering that endurance sports can have characteristics conducive to boredom. To fill this gap, we investigated boredom in endurance sports, along with its antecedents and consequences, through the lens of control-value theory (CVT). In a study involving 667 recreational runners and cyclists, we found support for CVT’s predictions. Specifically, lower levels of self-concept, greater levels of underchallenge and overchallenge, as well as lower levels of value were all linked to increased boredom. In turn, higher levels of boredom were associated with more negative psychological (e.g., less satisfaction) and behavioral consequences (e.g., reduced training). Few differences emerged between runners and cyclists, and these differences were primarily in the magnitude of effects. Overall, our research demonstrates that CVT is a promising theoretical framework for studying boredom in sports and exercise. Conversely, endurance sports provides a natural environment in which people experience boredom, and studying boredom in this context might thus provide novel insights into boredom research and CVT. This perspective also suggests actionable insights for practitioners and researchers to mitigate boredom more effectively. \n\n\n\n\n\n2025\n\n\nMaik Bieleke, Wanja Wolff, Catharina Cremer, Fanni Kaisinger, Thomas Goetz\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnstrengung, Langeweile, Krisen: Neue Perspektiven und Ansätze zur Selbstkontrolle im Sport\n\n\nSportpsychologie: Grundlagen und Trends\n\n\n\nbook chapter\n\n\n\nWie einfach es ist, sich Ziele zu setzen, zeigt ein Blick auf die vielfach gefassten, jedoch selten erfolgreich umgesetzten Neujahrsvorsätze vieler Menschen. Ziele zu erreichen ist ungleich schwieriger, da situativ attraktiver erscheinende Handlungsalternativen willentlich unterdrückt werden müssen und stattdessen als aversiv wahrgenommene Verhaltensweisen auszuführen sind (z. B. Training bei schlechtem Wetter) bzw. auf attraktivere Verhaltensweisen zu verzichten ist (z. B. Ausruhen auf dem Sofa). Dieser willentliche Kontrollprozess wird als Selbstkontrolle bezeichnet. Die daraus resultierende Lücke zwischen den gesetzten Zielen und dem tatsächlich gezeigten Verhalten tritt häufig in sportspezifischen Kontexten auf und wird meist auf eine Beeinträchtigung der Selbstkontrolle attribuiert. Dem liegt die traditionelle Sichtweise von Selbstkontrolle als einer limitierten Ressource zugrunde, deren Erschöpfung es in der Folge schwieriger macht, Hindernisse bei der Zielerreichung zu überwinden. In diesem Kapitel stellen wir dieser Perspektive aktuelle Ansätze gegenüber, die Selbstkontrolle als eine motivierte Kosten-Nutzen-Abwägung konzipieren und damit den Fokus auf die Bereitschaft legen, Selbstkontrolle auszuüben. Am Beispiel von Langeweile und Handlungskrisen illustrieren wir, wie sich die Kosten und Nutzen von Selbstkontrolle während der Erreichung sportlicher Ziele verändern können. Einerseits kann das Empfinden von Langeweile oder das Erleben einer Krise den Fokus auf alternative, potenziell lohnenswertere Ziele lenken, wodurch der Wert der aktuellen Zielerreichung und damit der Nutzen von Selbstkontrolle sinkt. Gleichzeitig handelt es sich bei Langeweile und Krisen um aversive Zustände, deren Regulation Anstrengung erfordert und die so die Kosten von Selbstkontrolle erhöhen können. Abschließend widmen wir uns der Frage, wie Menschen mit Langeweile und Krisen im Sport umgehen und welche Strategien dabei helfen können, die Bereitschaft zur Ausübung von Selbstkontrolle im Sport aufrechtzuerhalten. \n\n\n\n\n\n2024\n\n\nMaik Bieleke, Lucas Keller, Chris Englert\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeeling politics at school: Antecedents and effects of emotions in civic education\n\n\nPolitical Psychology\n\n\n\njournal article\n\n\noriginal research\n\n\n\nStudies on voters have shown that emotions are an important factor in politics. However, less is known about emotions experienced by adolescents in the context of civic education. Applying the control-value theory to a cross-curricular context, we analyze the relations between two types of emotions experienced in civic education and their antecedents and effects on learning: achievement emotions experienced during in-class political discussions and epistemic emotions experienced during individual processing of political information in school. We hypothesized both types of emotions relate to control and value appraisal antecedents (e.g., internal political efficacy, personal importance). Further, we expected—depending on the specific emotion—positive or negative relations with academic outcomes (e.g., motivation, engagement, and knowledge). Data were collected with an online questionnaire in Austrian upper secondary schools with students (N = 594, Mage = 17.1) from grades 10 to 13. Bivariate latent correlations broadly support the expectations: We found mainly positive associations of antecedents and outcomes to enjoyment, hope, pride, curiosity, and surprise and negative associations to hopelessness, confusion, and boredom, but more complex correlation patterns for anxiety, anger, and shame. The results provide first insights into which emotions are experienced during political learning and underscore the importance of acknowledging the role of emotions in civic education. \n\n\n\n\n\n2024\n\n\nElisabeth Graf, Thomas Goetz, Maik Bieleke, Dana Murano\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInner obstacles and goal-directed behaviors of elite and youth level cyclists: A qualitative analysis from the perspective of athletes and coaches\n\n\n\n\n\n\njournal article\n\n\noriginal research\n\n\n\n Journal of Applied Sport and Exercise Psychology\n\n\n\n\n\n2024\n\n\nAnna Hirsch, Maik Bieleke, Julia Schüler, Wanja Wolff\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssessing and exploring self-enacted behavior change techniques: Frequency, structure, and relevance for physical activity and healthy eating\n\n\n\n\n\n\njournal article\n\n\noriginal research\n\n\n\n Current Psychology\n\n\n\n\n\n2024\n\n\nJulia Schüler, Maik Bieleke\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatent profiles of effort functions and their impact on task experience and behavior\n\n\n\n\n\n\npreprint\n\n\noriginal research\n\n\n\n PsyArXiv\n\n\n\n\n\n2024\n\n\nJohanna Stähler, Wanja Wolff, Maik Bieleke, Julia Schüler\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBug or feature?

Although intuitive and widespread, this assumption lacks an empirical basis and a theoretical framework. We conducted a field experiment and randomly assigned 208 students to an easy-to-difficult or a difficult-to-easy condition in a mathematics test. Perceived challenge was measured along with control appraisals, value appraisals, and emotions (enjoyment, pride, anxiety, anger, boredom). While students starting with easy tasks felt less challenged than students starting with difficult tasks in Part 1, no differences emerged regarding control and value appraisals and emotions. In Part 2, students who had started with easy tasks proceeded to difficult tasks and reported a higher level of challenge, less value and control, and less positive and more negative emotions than students who proceeded from difficult-to-easy tasks. Control and value appraisals mediated the differences between the two conditions, especially regarding positive emotions. These results cast doubt on the preference for easy-to-difficult over difficult-to-easy task orders, revealing their potential for causing adverse experiences at the end of the test (e.g., reflecting contrast effects). \n\n\n\n\n\n2023\n\n\nMaik Bieleke, Thomas Goetz, Maike Krannich, Anna-Lena Roos, Takuya Yanagida\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeasuring emotions in mathematics: The Achievement Emotions Questionnaire—Mathematics (AEQ-M)\n\n\nZDM Mathematics Education\n\n\n\njournal article\n\n\nscale development\n\n\n\nUnderstanding the structure, antecedents, and outcomes of students’ emotions has become a topic of major interest in research on mathematics education. Much of this work is based on the Achievement Emotions Questionnaire—Mathematics (AEQ-M), a self-report instrument assessing students’ mathematics-related emotions. The AEQ-M measures seven emotions (enjoyment, pride, anger, anxiety, shame, hopelessness, boredom) across class, learning, and test contexts (internal structure). Based on control-value theory, it is assumed that these emotions are evoked by control and value appraisals, and that they influence students’ motivation, learning strategies, and performance (external relations). Despite the popularity and frequent use of the AEQ-M, the research leading to its development has never been published, creating uncertainty about the validity of the proposed internal structure and external relations. We close this gap in Study 1 (N = 781 students, Grades 5–10, mean age 14.1 years, 53.5% female) by demonstrating that emotions are organized across contexts and linked to their proposed antecedents and outcomes. Study 2 (N = 699 students, Grade 7 and 9, mean age 14.0 years, 56.9% female) addresses another deficit in research on the AEQ-M, the lack of evidence regarding the assumption that emotions represent sets of interrelated affective, cognitive, motivational, and physiological/expressive components. We close this gap by evaluating extended AEQ-M scales, systematically assessing these components for five core mathematics emotions (enjoyment, anger, anxiety, hopelessness, boredom). Our work provides solid grounds for future research using the AEQ-M to assess emotions and their components in the domain of mathematics. \n\n\n\n\n\n2023\n\n\nMaik Bieleke, Thomas Goetz, Takuya Yanagida, Elouise Botes, Anne C.

To maximize its effectiveness, it is paramount to investigate psychological factors that predict adherence to social distancing guidelines and examine corresponding interventions. We focused on individual differences in if-then planning, self-control, and boredom, and tested an intervention based on if-then planning. We conducted a two-wave longitudinal study combining observational and experimental methods. Participants (N = 574, 35.7% female, age: M = 37.5 years, SD = 10.8) reported their adherence to social distancing guidelines and the perceived difficulty of adherence at T1, along with trait measures of if-then planning, self-control, and boredom. Afterwards, they were randomly assigned to an if-then planning intervention to increase adherence, or to a control intervention. One week later at T2, participants again reported their adherence and the perceived difficulty of adhering. Multiple regression and structural equation modeling were used to establish whether trait if-then planning, self-control, and boredom predicted adherence, and to examine the effects of the if-then planning intervention. Trait if-then planning, self-control, and boredom were associated with T1 adherence, while only if-then planning and boredom predicted T2 adherence. No overall treatment effect of the if-then planning intervention emerged; however, participants who complied with the intervention (75.6%) maintained higher levels of adherence over time than control participants. In sum, individual differences in if-then planning, self-control, and boredom predicted adherence to social distancing guidelines. If-then planning interventions are promising but require further steps to ascertain compliance. \n\n\n\n\n\n2023\n\n\nMaik Bieleke, Corinna S.

Based on the control-value theory of achievement emotions, we hypothesized that students may experience significant levels of boredom during testing (“test boredom”; Hypothesis 1) and that test boredom may be significantly related to theoretically hypothesized antecedents (control and value appraisals; Hypothesis 2) and outcomes (performance; Hypothesis 3). We further hypothesized that test boredom was more detrimental when students felt overchallenged during the test than when they felt underchallenged (“abundance hypothesis”; Hypothesis 4). We tested these hypotheses in two studies (Study 1: N = 208 eighth graders; 54% female; Study 2: N = 1,612 fifth to 10th graders, 47% female) using both trait and state measures of test boredom in mathematics and their proposed antecedents and outcomes. In support of Hypothesis 1, participants reported statistically significant levels of boredom during tests. Furthermore, the relations of test boredom with its control and value antecedents (i.e., being over- or underchallenged, facets of value) were in line with our assumptions (Hypothesis 2). In support of Hypothesis 3, test boredom was significantly negatively related to academic achievement (grades). In line with Hypothesis 4, test scores were negatively related to boredom due to being overchallenged but unrelated, or even positively related, to boredom due to being underchallenged. Directions for future research on test boredom as well as practical implications are outlined. \n\n\n\n\n\n2023\n\n\nThomas Goetz, Maik Bieleke, Takuya Yanagida, Maike Krannich, Anna-Lena Roos, Anne C.

Unfortunately, existing interventions aiming at the promotion of physical activity seem incapable of stopping or reversing this trend. In the ProPELL research project, we therefore adopt a novel multidisciplinary and multimethodological approach to promote physical activity with a dedicated focus on physical exercise. In a 21-week randomized controlled trial (RCT) study, participants in the experimental group receive an eight-week lab-based jump training, while participants in the control group receive no training. This is followed by an eight-week observation of physical activity and exercise behavior in both groups. Various physiological (e.g., cardiovascular, neuromuscular, and endocrine) and psychological (e.g., motivational, emotional, and behavioral) parameters are measured in both conditions at three time points: at baseline, after the intervention, and after the follow-up. This will be complemented by continuous measurements of exercise- and activity-related variables (e.g., physical activity, heart rate). The analyses will focus on changes and dynamic interactions of the assessed parameters during the intervention and the follow-up period, for instance, by capitalizing on visual data analytics. \n\n\n\n\n\n2022\n\n\nMaik Bieleke, Ursula Fischer, Markus Gruber, Martina Kanning, Daniel Keim, Daniela Mier, Jens Pruessner, Julia Schüler\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoredom is the root of all evil — or is it? A psychometric network approach to individual differences in behavioral responses to boredom\n\n\nRoyal Society Open Science\n\n\n\njournal article\n\n\noriginal research\n\n\nscale development\n\n\n\nFunctional accounts of boredom propose that boredom serves as an impartial signal to change something about the current situation, which should give rise to adaptive and maladaptive behaviour alike. This seemingly contrasts with research on boredom proneness, which has overwhelmingly shown associations with maladaptive behaviour. To shed light on this discrepancy, we disentangled boredom proneness from individual differences in (i) the urge to avoid and escape boredom and (ii) adaptive and maladaptive ways of dealing with boredom by developing corresponding trait scales. In a study with N = 636 participants, psychometric network modelling revealed tight associations between boredom proneness and less adaptive and (especially) more maladaptive ways of dealing with boredom. However, its associations with the urge to avoid and escape boredom were rather weak. Importantly, a higher urge to avoid and escape boredom was linked not only to more maladaptive but also to more adaptive ways of dealing with boredom. This pattern of results was robust across various specific behaviours that have previously been linked to boredom. Our findings provide novel evidence for functional accounts of boredom from an individual difference perspective, cautioning against a shallow view of boredom as being associated with purely maladaptive behaviour. \n\n\n\n\n\n2022\n\n\nMaik Bieleke, Leonie Ripper, Julia Schüler, Wanja Wolff\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe agonizing effects of uncertainty: Effects of announced vs. unannounced performance assessments on emotions and achievement\n\n\nPLoS ONE\n\n\n\njournal article\n\n\noriginal research\n\n\n\nPerformance assessments play an essential role in performance diagnostics at schools. In practice, both announced and unannounced assessments are regularly used. However, it is unclear whether assessments are better administered announced or unannounced. From a theoretical perspective, it can be argued that announced assessments, mediated by the greater degree of students’ subjective control that accompanies them, should have a more beneficial effect on emotions, as well as the subsequently resulting performance, than unannounced assessments. To investigate these assumptions, emotion (enjoyment, anxiety) and achievement data (grades) were collected from 414 students in 19 lower- and upper-level tracks at a German secondary school on both announced and unannounced performance assessments. Less anxiety and more enjoyment occurred on the announced assessments. Moreover, enjoyment and anxiety were predictors of performance (i.e., school grades), which was better overall on announced assessments than on unannounced ones. The results of our field study suggest that announced assessments have more beneficial effects on emotions than unannounced assessments. \n\n\n\n\n\n2022\n\n\nMaik Bieleke, Jean-Marie Schwarzkopf, Thomas Goetz, Ludwig Haag\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting trapped in a dead end?

Whether this reflects the depletion of a global self-control resource is subject to an ongoing debate. We turned to boredom as a potential confounding variable to advance this debate. In a high-powered experiment (N = 719), participants worked on a primary (transcription) task of varying self-control demands (low, high) and length (2, 4, 8 min), followed by a secondary (Stroop) task with low and high self-control demanding trials. In addition to trait boredom, we measured effort, difficulty, tiredness, frustration, and boredom after the primary task and repeatedly during the secondary task. Effort, difficulty, tiredness, and frustration increased with the demand and duration of the primary task; however, without affecting performance in the secondary task. Importantly, participants rated both the primary and the secondary task as boring, and higher boredom at the state and the trait level was associated with lower effort and higher difficulty, tiredness, and frustration. During the secondary task, boredom increased steadily but was generally lower in more self-control demanding trials. Finally, boredom predicted performance in the secondary task. These results show an intricate relationship between self-control and boredom that research on these two constructs should carefully disentangle. \n\n\n\n\n\n2021\n\n\nMaik Bieleke, Leon Barton, Wanja Wolff\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe AEQ-S: A short version of the Achievement Emotions Questionnaire\n\n\nContemporary Educational Psychology\n\n\n\njournal article\n\n\nscale development\n\n\n\nThe Achievement Emotions Questionnaire (AEQ) is a well-established instrument for measuring achievement emotions in educational research and beyond. Its popularity rests on the coverage of the component structure of various achievement emotions across different academic settings. However, this broad conceptual scope requires the administration of 6 to 12 items per scale (Mdn = 10), which limits the applicability of the AEQ in empirical studies that necessitate brief administration times. We therefore developed the AEQ-S, a short version of the AEQ, with only 4 items per scale that nevertheless maintain the conceptual scope of the instrument. We validated the AEQ-S based on a reanalysis of Pekrun, Goetz, Frenzel, Barchfeld, and Perry’s (2011) dataset (N = 389 university students) and by administering them to a new and independent validation sample (N = 471 university students). Despite their brevity, the AEQ-S scales achieved satisfactory reliability and correlated substantially with the original AEQ scales. Moreover, structural relationships and intercorrelations between the scales and their relations with external measures of antecedents and outcomes of achievement emotions were highly similar for the AEQ-S and AEQ scales. These findings suggest that the AEQ-S is a suitable substitute for the AEQ when administration time is limited. \n\n\n\n\n\n2021\n\n\nMaik Bieleke, Katarzyna Gogol, Thomas Goetz, Lia Daniels, Reinhard Pekrun\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndividual differences in if-then planning: Insights from the development and application of the If-Then Planning Scale (ITPS)\n\n\nPersonality and Individual Differences\n\n\n\njournal article\n\n\nscale development\n\n\n\nMaking if-then plans is a self-regulation strategy that facilitates goal attainment. An open question is, however, whether there are individual differences in if-then planning. We, therefore, developed and validated the If-Then Planning Scale (ITPS) in three independent studies with more than 2600 participants. The ITPS is conceptually grounded in implementation intention theory, measuring whether individuals identify critical situations (if-part) and plan goal-directed behaviors (then-part) in terms of opportunities and obstacles. We established the psychometric qualities of the ITPS in Studies 1a and 1b and its convergent and discriminant validity in Studies 2 and 3. Applying the ITPS, we showed that if-then planning is associated with the attainment of environmental goals (Studies 1a and 1b), socioeconomic status (Studies 1a, 1b, and 2), and academic achievement (Study 3). Our results demonstrate individual differences in if-then planning that can be efficiently and reliably measured with the ITPS, and reveal systematic associations between these individual differences and goal attainment. \n\n\n\n\n\n2021\n\n\nMaik Bieleke, Lucas Keller\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf-then planning\n\n\nEuropean Review of Social Psychology\n\n\n\njournal article\n\n\nliterature review\n\n\n\nThe self-regulation strategy of forming implementation intentions has now been studied for almost 30 years. We trace the development of this research and explicate the questions that have been addressed. We then present current research that investigates the consequences of implementation intentions for flexible goal striving, behaviour in situations for which one had not planned, and neuropsychological processes underlying the action control by implementation intentions. Next, we turn to novel applications focusing on how implementation intentions affect physical endurance and promote strategic information processing. Our review concludes with an outlook on future research on implementation intentions that covers emerging individual difference perspectives, innovative approaches to characterize underlying cognitive processes, and the prospects of integrating insights from related fields of research. As such, our review is an empathic call for addressing the many intriguing conceptual and empirical questions that still revolve around implementation intentions. \n\n\n\n\n\n2021\n\n\nMaik Bieleke, Lucas Keller, Peter M.

We hypothesized reciprocal associations between student-teacher relationship quality (i.e., interpersonal closeness) and students’ emotions in the classroom (i.e., enjoyment, pride, anxiety, anger, boredom, and shame). Data from a two-wave longitudinal study with annual assessments in grade 10 (Time 1) and 11 (Time 2) were used to test this hypothesis (N = 535; mean age at Time 1: 16.7 years, SD = 0.6). Student-perceived relationship quality and students’ emotions were assessed in the academic domains of mathematics, German, English, and French. In line with our hypothesis, cross-lagged panel models showed reciprocal associations: Higher relationship quality was associated with stronger positive emotions and weaker negative emotions over time. In turn, lower negative emotions and higher positive emotions were associated with higher relationship quality. The association between initial emotions and student-teacher relationship quality one year later was stronger than the reverse association. Further, the links between relationship quality and emotions were largely equivalent across school domains but differed in strength across emotions. Implications for future research and educational practice are discussed. \n\n\n\n\n\n2021\n\n\nThomas Goetz, Maik Bieleke, Katarzyna Gogol, Jan van Tartwijk, Tim Mainhard, Anastasiya A.

We investigate how individual social value orientation (SVO) relates to controlled information acquisition and how this relationship may be governed by intuitive versus reflective decision modes. We measure controlled information acquisition with the process tracing tool Mouselab and demonstrate its potential for advancing research on social decision-making. In two experiments, participants worked on two consecutive SVO tasks, in which they allocated points between themselves and others. Information regarding the available distributions of points had to be actively acquired by moving the mouse cursor over corresponding boxes on the screen. We observed a stable relationship between SVO and controlled information acquisition in both experiments: less selfish participants acquired more information and made more other-oriented acquisitions, and this relationship showed up in both an intuitive and a reflective decision mode. However, participants in a reflective decision mode acquired more information, their acquisitions were more strongly other-oriented, and their decisions were more prosocial compared to participants in an intuitive mode. Taken together, our results advance research on SVO by showing that non-selfish individuals invest considerable time and effort to gauge the consequences of their decisions for others, which might underlie the pervasive effects of SVO on many socially relevant behaviors. Moreover, we demonstrate how intuitive versus reflective decision modes can alter controlled information acquisition. Finally, our results illustrate that Mouselab is a simple-to-use and versatile tool for tracing cognitive processes underlying social psychological phenomena. \n\n\n\n\n\n2020\n\n\nMaik Bieleke, David Dohmen, Peter M.

A pilot field study on the effects of conveying self-control strategies on volleyball service performance\n\n\nBehavioral Sciences\n\n\n\njournal article\n\n\noriginal research\n\n\n\nVolleyball serves constitute an important example for a self-controlled sequence of actions in sports that is difficult to improve. It is therefore paramount to investigate whether and how conveying self-control strategies to athletes affects their service performance. To address this question, we conducted a pilot field study with sixty-two players from four Swiss volleyball schools. They performed a warm-up and subsequently a first series of 15 serves. Objective service performance was measured in terms of errors, velocity, and precision. Afterwards, players formulated either individual goals (goal condition) or plans (plan condition) based on their coaches’ correction instructions. In a second series of 15 serves objective performance was worse in some respects compared to the first series (i.e., more errors in the plan condition, reduced precision in both conditions). Mixed-effects analyses of performance development across conditions in the second series showed initially reduced but steadily recouping precision and velocity, while the number of errors stayed constant. In contrast to the objective performance, coaches evaluated their players’ service performance during the second series of serves as substantially better than during the first series. Taken together, the results of this pilot field study suggest that conveying either goals or plans as self-control strategies may involve initial adjustment costs followed by a subsequent recovery period. \n\n\n\n\n\n2019\n\n\nMaik Bieleke, Claudio Kriech, Wanja Wolff\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMindset theory of action phases and if-then planning\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbook chapter\n\n\n\n Social Psychology in Action\n\n\n\n\n\n2019\n\n\nLucas Keller, Maik Bieleke, Peter M.

Yet, little is known about the consequences of forming implementation intentions for goal attainment in situations that were not specified in the if-then plan. In three experiments, we assessed goal attainment in terms of speed and accuracy in an object classification task, focusing on situations that were similar or dissimilar to critical situations and required planned or different responses. The results of Experiments 1 and 3 provide evidence for a facilitation of planned responses in critical and in sufficiently similar situations, enhancing goal attainment when the planned response was required and impairing it otherwise. In Experiment 3, additional unfavorable effects however emerged in situations that were dissimilar to the critical one but required the planned response as well. We discuss theoretical implications as well as potential benefits and pitfalls emerging from these non-planned effects of forming implementation intentions. \n\n\n\n\n\n2018\n\n\nMaik Bieleke, Eve Legrand, Astrid Mignon, Peter M.

We measured SVO one week prior to an ultimatum game experiment in which participants had to accept or reject a series of 10 ultimatum offers including very low (unfair) ones. Before making these decisions, participants mentally contrasted their individual goals with the obstacle of pondering at length or acting in a hasty way; then they made the plan to adopt an intuitive or a reflective mode of processing (intuitive and reflective condition, respectively), or made no such plans (control condition). Participants with rather high (prosocial) SVO scores were more likely to accept unfair offers in the reflective than the intuitive condition. This effect also evinced for a subset of selfish individuals; however, the majority with rather low (selfish) scores made similar decisions in both conditions. This pattern of results suggests that SVO moderates the effects of intuitive versus reflective modes of processing on responses to low ultimatum offers. \n\n\n\n\n\n2017\n\n\nMaik Bieleke, Peter M.

Flexibly tenacious goal striving with implementation intentions\n\n\nMotivation Science\n\n\n\njournal article\n\n\noriginal research\n\n\n\nImplementation intentions (if-then plans) help people to automatically perform goal-directed behaviors when they encounter goal-relevant critical situations. Besides the intended beneficial effects on goal attainment, however, goal-directed behaviors might entail various costs. Successful goal striving then requires flexible tenacity: tenaciously holding on to behaviors that inflict bearable costs but flexibly backing off from performing excessively costly behaviors. In the present research, we investigated whether goal striving with implementation intentions is characterized by such flexible tenacity. In Experiments 1 and 2, implementation intention participants held on to goal-directed behaviors that inflicted bearable costs (sustaining unpleasant noise and annoying effort), whereas participants with mere goal intentions reduced their performance of goal-directed behaviors. In Experiment 3, both goal and implementation intention participants backed off from performing an excessively costly behavior (involving monetary loss). This effect was more pronounced among implementation intention participants, who additionally lowered their goal commitment. We conclude that implementation intentions render goal striving tenaciously flexible, facilitating goal-directed behaviors unless this is associated with excessive costs. \n\n\n\n\n\n2017\n\n\nEve Legrand, Maik Bieleke, Peter M.

    "section": "Background",
    "text": "Background\nThe Achievement Emotions Questionnaire (AEQ) is a well-established and widely used instrument for measuring achievement emotions. It covers the component structure of various emotions across three diffent academic settings. However, this breadth requires a total of 232 items distributed across 24 scales, making the AEQ difficult to use when administration time is limited. The AEQ-S addresses this issue by reducing the number of items to 96 (i.e., 4 items per scale), allowing much more economic assessments. Despite its brevity, the AEQ-S is a reliable instrument that maintains the AEQ’s conceptual scope and reproduces its structural relationships (e.g., with external criteria). This makes the AEQ-S a valuable instrument when administration time or space are limited.\nThe internal structure of the AEQ-S is identical to the AEQ, as it uses a subset of items from all AEQ sections and scales. Accordingly, the AEQ-S is organized in three sections: class-related emotions, learning-related emotions, and test-related emotions. Each section consists of eight scales, and each scale comprises four items pertaining to an individual achievement emotion. The AEQ-S maintains the component structure of the AEQ as well. Each scale measures the affective, cognitive, motivational, and physiological component of the corresponding achievement emotion with one item each (except the physiological component of hope, for which no items exist in the AEQ)."

    "text": "Adminstration\n\nAdministration\nThe AEQ-S can be administered in an online or in a paper-and-pencil format. Completing it takes about 15 minutes. The AEQ-S is a modular instrument, allowing researchers to use sections (e.g., learning-related emotions) and scales (e.g., test anxiety) individually. This reduces the administration time accordingly; for instance, a single scale with four items can be completed in less than a minute. Participants rate each of the eight items on a 5-point Likert scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree).\n\n\nInstruction\nThe instructions used for the AEQ-S focus on general emotional experiences across subjects (i.e., traits). However, they can also be changed to focus on emotions in a specific subject domain (e.g., math, sports) and/or emotions in a specific situation (i.e., states). It is not necessary to change the wording of the items.\n\n\nScoring and interpretation\nAn overall score for each scale is obtained by averaging a participant’s ratings across all four items. All items are formulated in the same direction so that no reverse-coding is neccessary."

You can adapt the AEQ-S in any way you want, including translations into other languages. Just make sure to give appropriate credit in the resulting publications (see above).\n\n\nIs the AEQ-S already available in languages other than English?\nThe AEQ-S has so far been validated in English. However, the items of the AEQ-S are drawn form a broader pool of original AEQ items, which have been translated in other languages and can therefore serve as a starting point for translating the AEQ-S. Naturally, these translations must then undergo thorough validation to ensure that their reliability and validity are maintained."

Participants rate each of the eight items on a 7-point Likert scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree).\n\n\nInstruction\nThe ITPS has been developed as a domain-general measure of if-then planning. Accordingly, the instruction refers to goals in general and not to a specific goal. The focus is on difficult and important goals as only these goals require if-then planning to facilitate goal attainment. However, the instruction can in principle also be tailored to specific goals (e.g., health goals, learning goals) if the focus is on if-then planning in a particular domain.\n\n\nScoring and interpretation\nAn overall score is obtained by averaging a participant’s ratings across all eight items. All items are formulated in the same direction so that no reverse-coding is neccessary. A higher ITPS score indicates a greater propensity to engage in if-then planning.\nNote that although the ITPS is composed of different subscales (e.g., thinking about potential obstacles), subscale scores should only be used for explorative analyses. In general, it is recommended to interpret the overall ITPS score."
