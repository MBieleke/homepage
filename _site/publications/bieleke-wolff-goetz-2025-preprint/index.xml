<abstract>
<p>Boredom is a common experience in daily life, yet it has been largely
overlooked in the context of sports and exercise. This neglect is
perplexing, especially considering that endurance sports can have
characteristics conducive to boredom. To fill this gap, we investigated
boredom in endurance sports, along with its antecedents and
consequences, through the lens of control-value theory (CVT). In a study
involving 667 recreational runners and cyclists, we found support for
CVTâ€™s predictions. Specifically, lower levels of self-concept, greater
levels of underchallenge and overchallenge, as well as lower levels of
value were all linked to increased boredom. In turn, higher levels of
boredom were associated with more negative psychological (e.g., less
satisfaction) and behavioral consequences (e.g., reduced training). Few
differences emerged between runners and cyclists, and these differences
were primarily in the magnitude of effects. Overall, our research
demonstrates that CVT is a promising theoretical framework for studying
boredom in sports and exercise. Conversely, endurance sports provides a
natural environment in which people experience boredom, and studying
boredom in this context might thus provide novel insights into boredom
research and CVT. This perspective also suggests actionable insights for
practitioners and researchers to mitigate boredom more effectively.</p>
